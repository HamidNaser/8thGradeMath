### 1. Arithmetic Sequence Rule
**Question:** What is the rule for the arithmetic sequence shown in the table?
| Position (n) | Term (An) |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | 22        |
| 2            | 33        |
| 3            | 44        |
| 4            | 55        |
| 5            | 66        |

**Options:**

A) \( f(n) = 22 + 11(n) \) for \( n > 0 \)  
B) \( f(n) = 22 - 11(n) \) for \( n > 0 \)  
C) \( f(n) = 22 + 11(n-1) \) for \( n > 0 \)  
D) \( f(n) = 22 - 11(n-1) \) for \( n > 0 \)  

**Answer:** The correct rule is **C) \( f(n) = 22 + 11(n-1) \) for \( n > 0 \)**.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Identify the common difference.
   - From 22 to 33: \( 33 - 22 = 11 \)
   - From 33 to 44: \( 44 - 33 = 11 \)
   - The common difference is 11.
2. Write the rule in the form \( f(n) = a + d(n-1) \), where \( a \) is the first term and \( d \) is the common difference.
   - First term \( a = 22 \)
   - Common difference \( d = 11 \)
   - Rule: \( f(n) = 22 + 11(n-1) \)

### 2. Solving the Equation
**Question:** 

What are the solutions to the equation \( 2x + 2.5 - 1 = 5 \)?

**Options:**

A) \( x = 0.5 \) and \( x = 5.5 \)  
B) \( x = 0.5 \) and \( x = -5.5 \)  
C) \( x = -0.5 \) and \( x = 5.5 \)  
D) \( x = -0.5 \) and \( x = -5.5 \)  

**Answer:** The correct solutions are **none of the given options**. The correct solution is \( x = 1.75 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Simplify the equation.
   - \( 2x + 1.5 = 5 \)
2. Subtract 1.5 from both sides.
   - \( 2x = 3.5 \)
3. Divide both sides by 2.
   - \( x = 1.75 \)

### 3. Solving the Inequality
**Question:** 

What are the solutions to the inequality \( 12x + 21 > 5 \)?

**Options:**

A) \( -11 < x < 9 \)  
B) \( -9 < x < 11 \)  
C) \( x < -9 \) or \( x > 11 \)  
D) \( x < -11 \) or \( x > 9 \)  

**Answer:** The correct solutions are **none of the given options**. The correct solution is \( x > -\frac{4}{3} \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Subtract 21 from both sides.
   - \( 12x > -16 \)
2. Divide both sides by 12.
   - \( x > -\frac{4}{3} \)

### 4. Function Value
**Question:** 

What is the value of \( f(-2) \) given \( f(x) = -x^2 \) for \( x \leq -1 \) and \( f(x) = 4 \) for \( x > -1 \)?
**Answer:** The value of \( f(-2) \) is **-4**.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Determine which part of the function to use.
   - Since \( -2 \leq -1 \), use \( f(x) = -x^2 \).
2. Substitute \( -2 \) into the function.
   - \( f(-2) = -(-2)^2 = -4 \)

### 5. Vertex of the Function
**Question:** 

What are the coordinates of the vertex of the function \( f(x) = 1.5x + 33.1 \)?
**Answer:** This is a linear function, so it doesn't have a vertex. The y-intercept is **33.1**.

**Options:**

A) \( f(n) = f(n-1) + 4, f(1) = -1 \)  
B) \( f(n) = f(n-1) - 4, f(1) = -1 \)  
C) \( f(n) = f(n-1) + 6, f(1) = -1 \)  
D) \( f(n) = f(n-1) - 6, f(1) = -1 \)  

**Answer:** The correct rule is **C) \( f(n) = f(n-1) + 6, f(1) = -1 \)**.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Identify the common difference.
   - From -1 to 5: \( 5 - (-1) = 6 \)
   - From 5 to 11: \( 11 - 5 = 6 \)
   - The common difference is 6.
2. Write the recursive rule.
   - \( f(n) = f(n-1) + 6 \)
   - First term \( f(1) = -1 \)

### 8. Soil Shoveling Problem
**Question:** A landscaper is shoveling soil from a large pile into bags. The table shows the amount of soil, in cubic feet, that remains in the pile after x minutes.
| Minutes (x) | Amount of Soil (ftÂ³) |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| 0           | 540                   |
| 3.5         | 514.2                 |
| 7           | 488.4                 |
| 10.5        | 462.6                 |
| 14          | 436.8                 |

If the landscaper continues shoveling the soil at the same rate, how many cubic feet of soil will remain in the pile after 21 minutes?
**Answer:** The amount of soil remaining after 21 minutes is **385.23 cubic feet**.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Identify the rate of change.
   - From 540 to 514.2: \( 540 - 514.2 = 25.8 \)
   - The rate is 25.8 cubic feet per 3.5 minutes.
2. Calculate the rate per minute.
   - \( 25.8 / 3.5 = 7.37 \) cubic feet per minute.
3. Calculate the amount of soil remaining after 21 minutes.
   - \( 540 - (7.37 \times 21) = 540 - 154.77 = 385.23 \)

### 9. Common Difference of the Arithmetic Sequence
**Question:** 

What is the common difference of the arithmetic sequence defined by the recursive rule \( f(1) = 27, f(n) = f(n-1) + 9 \)?
**Answer:** The common difference is **9**.

### 10. Total Cost for Model Car Kits
**Question:** 

The cost in dollars of model car kits purchased at a hobby store is defined by the arithmetic sequence \( f(n) = 16 + 12(n-1) \) for \( n > 0 \), where \( n \) is the number of kits purchased. What is the total cost in dollars for 9 model car kits?
**Answer:** The total cost for 9 model car kits is **112 dollars**.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Substitute \( n = 9 \) into the formula.
   - f(9) = 16 + 12(9-1) = 112
   
### 11. Rate of Reading
**Question:** The table below shows the number of pages Rahul read of a book in a given number of minutes. What is the rate at which he read the book?
| Number of Pages | Time (minutes) |
|-----------------|----------------|
| 1               | 3              |
| 2               | 6              |
| 3               | 9              |
| 4               | 12             |
| 5               | 15             |

**Options:**

A) 1 page per minute  
B) 2 pages per minute  
C) 3 pages per minute  
D) 4 pages per minute  

**Answer:** The correct rate is **A) 1 page per minute**.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Identify the number of pages read and the corresponding time.
2. Calculate the rate by dividing the number of pages by the time.
   - For example, 1 page in 3 minutes: \( \frac{1}{3} \) pages per minute.
   - 2 pages in 6 minutes: \( \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \) pages per minute.
   - 3 pages in 9 minutes: \( \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} \) pages per minute.
   - 4 pages in 12 minutes: \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) pages per minute.
   - 5 pages in 15 minutes: \( \frac{5}{15} = \frac{1}{3} \) pages per minute.
3. The rate is consistent at \( \frac{1}{3} \) pages per minute, which means 1 page per minute.

### 12. Regression Equation Residual Plot
**Question:** Some of the points for the regression equation \( y = -2x + 10 \) are shown in the table. Graph a residual plot of the points.
| x | y  |
|---|----|
| 1 | 9  |
| 2 | 5  |
| 3 | 6  |
| 4 | 3  |
| 5 | 2  |
| 6 | -1 |

**Answer:** To graph a residual plot, follow these steps:

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Calculate the predicted \( y \) values using the regression equation \( y = -2x + 10 \).
   - For \( x = 1 \): \( y = -2(1) + 10 = 8 \)
   - For \( x = 2 \): \( y = -2(2) + 10 = 6 \)
   - For \( x = 3 \): \( y = -2(3) + 10 = 4 \)
   - For \( x = 4 \): \( y = -2(4) + 10 = 2 \)
   - For \( x = 5 \): \( y = -2(5) + 10 = 0 \)
   - For \( x = 6 \): \( y = -2(6) + 10 = -2 \)
2. Calculate the residuals (actual \( y \) - predicted \( y \)).
   - For \( x = 1 \): Residual = \( 9 - 8 = 1 \)
   - For \( x = 2 \): Residual = \( 5 - 6 = -1 \)
   - For \( x = 3 \): Residual = \( 6 - 4 = 2 \)
   - For \( x = 4 \): Residual = \( 3 - 2 = 1 \)
   - For \( x = 5 \): Residual = \( 2 - 0 = 2 \)
   - For \( x = 6 \): Residual = \( -1 - (-2) = 1 \)
3. Plot the residuals on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and residuals on the vertical axis.

### 13. Correlation vs. Causation

| Length of a workout and calories burned   |             |           |

**Answer:**
| Relationship                              | Correlation | Causation |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hours spent studying and test grade       |             | X         |
